Implement a circular version of the text book's generic `DoublyLinkedList`, *without any sentinels*, that supports all the public behaviours of the original DoublyLinkedList as well as two new methods: `rotate()`, `rotateBackward()`, you will maintain only a single reference to the underlying nodes in an instance variable called `tail` which references the last element in the circular list. You should make reference to the book's `CircularlyLinkedList` (singly linked) and the book's `DoublyLinkedList` to help you out. The solution should look like a combination of those two. Call your class `CircularlyDoublyLinkedList`

I've implemented a DJ program that will use your `CircularlyDoublyLinkedList` to play a song, such that each time the keyboard is pressed it will reverse the order of playback on the song. The DJ program will also perform some tests to help the grader ensure you've implemented the CircularlyLinkedList properly. If the word error appears in the console output (at the bottom of intellij) then you'll know there are some problems with your `CircularlyDoublyLinkedList` class.
